## 1. Setting Up the Environment

**First-time only.** This downloads Python and all scientific packages (~1.5-2.5 GB).

1. Open QuPath
2. Go to **Extensions > QP-CAT > Setup Clustering Environment**
3. Click **Setup Environment**
4. Wait for the download and build to complete (5-10 minutes depending on internet speed)
5. When "Environment setup complete!" appears, close the dialog
6. The rest of the QP-CAT menu items now become visible

**Troubleshooting:** If setup fails, check your internet connection and disk space (~2.5 GB needed). Use **Utilities > Rebuild Clustering Environment** to start fresh.

---

## 2. Running Clustering

Full clustering with all configuration options.

### Step-by-step:

1. Open an image with cell detections
2. **Extensions > QP-CAT > Run Clustering...**
3. **Scope** -- Choose "Current image" or "All project images"
4. **Measurements** -- Select the markers to cluster on
   - Click **Select 'Mean' only** for a good default (mean intensity per marker)
   - Or manually select specific measurements
5. **Normalization** -- Choose a scaling method
   - **Z-score** is recommended for most analyses
   - See [Best Practices](BEST_PRACTICES.md#normalization) for guidance
6. **Embedding** -- Choose dimensionality reduction
   - **UMAP** is recommended (preserves both local and global structure)
   - Adjust n_neighbors (2-200, default 15) and min_dist (0.0-1.0, default 0.1) if needed
7. **Algorithm** -- Choose a clustering method
   - **Leiden** is recommended for most use cases (auto-detects number of clusters)
   - Set algorithm-specific parameters (see [Parameter Reference](#algorithm-parameters) below)
8. **Analysis options** -- Check boxes as needed:
   - "Generate analysis plots" -- produces static PNGs (marker ranking, PAGA, dotplot)
   - "Spatial analysis" -- computes neighborhood enrichment and Moran's I
   - "Spatial feature smoothing" -- smooths features using spatial neighbors before clustering (see note below)
   - "Batch correction" -- applies Harmony (only for multi-image scope)
9. Click **Run Clustering**
10. View results in the results dialog (heatmap, scatter plot, marker rankings, plots)

### What happens to your data:

- Each detection gets a **PathClass** classification like "Cluster 0", "Cluster 1", etc.
- If embedding was computed, measurements **UMAP1/UMAP2** (or PCA1/PCA2, tSNE1/tSNE2) are added to each detection
- The QuPath viewer updates to show cluster colors on cells

### Spatial Feature Smoothing

When "Spatial feature smoothing" is checked, a graph convolution pre-step is applied before clustering:

1. A k-nearest neighbor graph is built from cell centroid coordinates
2. The adjacency matrix is row-normalized
3. Each cell's selected measurements are replaced by a weighted average of its spatial neighbors' values
4. The smoothed measurements are then passed to the chosen clustering algorithm

This makes **any** algorithm spatially-aware (not just BANKSY). Adjust the smoothing **k** parameter to control the spatial neighborhood size (default 15). Higher k = stronger smoothing across a larger neighborhood.

---

## 3. Quick Clustering

One-click clustering with sensible defaults. Good for initial exploration.

1. Open an image with cell detections
2. **Extensions > QP-CAT > Quick Cluster** and pick one:
   - **Quick Leiden (auto)** -- Leiden with n_neighbors=50, resolution=1.0, Z-score normalization, UMAP embedding
   - **Quick KMeans (k=10)** -- KMeans with 10 clusters
   - **Quick HDBSCAN (auto)** -- HDBSCAN with min_cluster_size=15
3. Wait for the notification that clustering is complete
4. Cell classifications are updated immediately

Quick Cluster automatically selects all "Mean" measurements and uses Z-score normalization with UMAP embedding.

---

## 4. Multi-Image Project Clustering

Cluster all images in a project together for globally consistent assignments.

1. Open a QuPath project with multiple images (each must have cell detections)
2. **Extensions > QP-CAT > Run Clustering...**
3. Select **All project images** scope
4. Configure measurements, normalization, algorithm as usual
5. Optionally enable **Batch correction (Harmony)** to account for per-image technical variation
6. Click **Run Clustering**

All detections across all images are combined into a single dataset, clustered together, and results are saved back to each image. This ensures "Cluster 3" in Image A is the same as "Cluster 3" in Image B.

**Note:** This loads all detection data into memory. For very large projects (>500,000 total cells), consider using MiniBatch KMeans.

---

## 5. Computing Embeddings Only

Add UMAP/PCA/t-SNE coordinates to detections without changing existing classifications.

1. **Extensions > QP-CAT > Compute Embedding Only...**
2. Select measurements and normalization
3. Choose embedding method (UMAP recommended)
4. Set parameters:
   - **n_neighbors** (2-200, default 15): larger = more global structure
   - **min_dist** (0.0-1.0, default 0.1): smaller = tighter clusters in the plot
5. Click **Compute Embedding**
6. Measurements UMAP1/UMAP2 (or PCA1/PCA2, tSNE1/tSNE2) are added to each detection

Existing cluster or phenotype classifications are preserved.

---

## 6. Rule-Based Phenotyping

Classify cells into biological types based on marker expression thresholds.

### Step-by-step:

1. **Extensions > QP-CAT > Run Phenotyping...**
2. **Select markers** from the measurement list
   - These should be biologically meaningful markers (e.g., CD3, CD8, CD20, PanCK)
   - Use **Select 'Mean' only** then deselect irrelevant markers
3. **Set normalization** -- determines how marker values are scaled before gating
   - Min-Max or Percentile recommended for gating (values in [0,1] range)
   - The "Default gate" spinner sets the initial gate for all markers
4. **Set per-marker gates** -- each marker column header has a spinner
   - Values represent the positive/negative threshold for that marker
   - You can drag the red threshold line on the histogram (see [Auto-Thresholding](#7-using-auto-thresholding))
5. **Define rules** -- each row is a phenotype:
   - **Cell Type**: name for this phenotype (e.g., "CD8+ T Cell")
   - **Marker columns**: set to "pos" or "neg" for each marker that defines this type
   - Leave markers blank if they are irrelevant for that type
   - Example: CD8+ T Cell = CD3: pos, CD8: pos, CD20: neg
6. **Rule order matters** -- rules are evaluated top-to-bottom, first match wins
   - Use the up/down arrows to reorder
   - Place more specific rules above more general ones
7. Click **Run Phenotyping**
8. Results dialog shows phenotype counts and distributions

### Example rule set for immune panel:

| Cell Type | CD3 | CD8 | CD4 | CD20 | PanCK |
|-----------|-----|-----|-----|------|-------|
| CD8+ T Cell | pos | pos | | neg | neg |
| CD4+ T Cell | pos | neg | pos | neg | neg |
| B Cell | neg | | | pos | neg |
| Tumor | neg | | | neg | pos |

## 7. Using Auto-Thresholding

Automatically compute marker gate thresholds instead of setting them manually.

1. In the Phenotyping dialog, select your markers
2. Expand the **Histogram & Auto-Thresholding** section
3. Click **Compute Thresholds**
4. Click any marker column header to view its histogram
5. The histogram shows:
   - Blue bars (below threshold) and red bars (above threshold)
   - A red dashed line at the current threshold
   - Statistics: "Pos: X (Y%) | Neg: Z (W%)"
6. Change the **Method** dropdown to apply an auto-threshold:
   - **Triangle** -- geometric method, good for skewed distributions
   - **GMM (Gaussian)** -- 2-component mixture model, good for bimodal data
   - **Gamma** -- gamma distribution fit, good for strictly positive markers
7. You can drag the red threshold line with the mouse for fine-tuning
8. Click **Apply to All Markers** to set all gates using the selected method

---

## 8. Extracting Foundation Model Features

Extract morphological embeddings from pre-trained vision foundation models and store them as per-detection measurements.

### Step-by-step:

1. Open an image with cell detections
2. **Extensions > QP-CAT > Extract Foundation Model Features...**
3. **Select a model** from the dropdown:
   - **H-optimus-0** (Bioptimus, 1536-dim) -- gated, requires HuggingFace token
   - **Virchow** (Paige AI, 2560-dim) -- gated, requires HuggingFace token
   - **Hibou-B** (HistAI, 768-dim) / **Hibou-L** (1024-dim) -- gated, requires HuggingFace token
   - **Midnight** (kaiko.ai, 768-dim) -- open access
   - **DINOv2-Large** (Meta AI, 1024-dim) -- open access
4. **For gated models:** Enter your HuggingFace auth token (obtain one at https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens after accepting the model's license on its HuggingFace page)
5. Click **Extract Features**
6. The model is downloaded on first use and cached locally for future runs
7. Wait for extraction to complete (progress shown in status bar)

### What happens to your data:

- Each detection receives measurements named `FM_0`, `FM_1`, ..., `FM_N` (where N depends on the model's embedding dimension)
- These measurements can be selected in the clustering dialog just like channel intensity measurements
- Foundation model features capture morphological and textural information from the image tile around each cell

### Using foundation model features for clustering:

1. After extraction, open **Run Clustering...**
2. In the measurement selection panel, select the `FM_*` measurements (you can use them alone or combined with channel intensity measurements)
3. Proceed with clustering as usual

**Note:** All included models use commercially permissive licenses (Apache 2.0). Models are not bundled with the extension -- they are downloaded on-demand from HuggingFace.

---

## 9. Zero-Shot Phenotyping

Assign cell phenotypes using natural language text prompts and the BiomedCLIP vision-language model -- no marker gating rules or training data required.

### Step-by-step:

1. Open an image with cell detections
2. **Extensions > QP-CAT > Zero-Shot Phenotyping (BiomedCLIP)...**
3. Enter phenotype text prompts in the text area, **one per line**. Examples:
   - `lymphocyte`
   - `tumor cell`
   - `stromal cell`
   - `macrophage`
   - `necrotic tissue`
4. Click **Run**
5. BiomedCLIP is downloaded on first use and cached locally (MIT License, Microsoft)
6. Wait for the model to process each cell's image tile against all prompts

### What happens to your data:

- Each detection receives a PathClass classification matching the highest-scoring text prompt
- A confidence score is stored as a measurement for each detection
- The QuPath viewer updates to show phenotype colors on cells

### Tips for effective prompts:

- Use concise, descriptive terms that a pathologist would use
- Be specific: "CD8-positive T lymphocyte" may work better than just "T cell"
- Add an "other" or "background" prompt as a catch-all for cells that do not match any specific type
- Experiment with different phrasings -- slight changes in wording can affect results

**Note:** BiomedCLIP does not require a HuggingFace auth token. It is downloaded on-demand and cached locally.

## 10. Managing Clusters (Rename/Merge)

Organize cluster assignments after clustering.

1. **Extensions > QP-CAT > Manage Clusters...**
2. The dialog shows all classifications with cell counts
3. **To rename:** Select one cluster, click **Rename...**, enter the new name
   - Example: "Cluster 3" -> "CD8+ T Cells"
4. **To merge:** Select two or more clusters (Ctrl/Cmd+click), click **Merge Selected**
   - Enter a name for the merged cluster
   - All selected clusters are reassigned to the new name
5. Click **Refresh** if you make changes outside the dialog

Changes are applied immediately to detection objects.

---

## 10. [TEST] Autoencoder Cell Classifier

Train a VAE-based classifier on labeled cells, then apply across the project. This is a **test feature**.

### Training

1. **Label cells** in QuPath using the standard classification tools (right-click > Set class). Label 100-200 cells per cell type for best results. Cluster labels (e.g., "Cluster 0") are ignored -- only your custom class names are used.
2. **Extensions > QP-CAT > [TEST] Autoencoder Classifier...**
3. **Choose input mode:**
   - **Measurements** (default, recommended): Select measurements to use (typically "Mean" channel intensities). Fast, CPU-friendly.
   - **Tile images**: Uses pixel data around each cell. Captures morphology and texture. Choose tile size (32x32 recommended). Slower, benefits from GPU.
4. **Cell mask channel** (tile mode only, default ON): Appends a binary mask of the cell's outline as an extra channel. This tells the network which cell is the target while preserving neighbor context. Based on CellSighter (Amitay et al. 2023, Nature Communications).
5. **Adjust training parameters** if desired (defaults work well for most cases):
   - Latent dimensions: 16 (how compressed the representation is; 8-32 typical)
   - Epochs: 100 (maximum training iterations; early stopping may stop sooner)
   - Supervision weight: 1.0 (how strongly labels influence the model; 0 = unsupervised)
   - Learning rate: 0.001 (OneCycleLR scheduler adjusts this automatically)
   - Batch size: 128 (reduce for tile mode if out of memory)
   - Validation split: 0.2 (20% holdout for early stopping and best model selection)
   - Early stop patience: 15 (epochs without val improvement before stopping; 0 = disabled)
   - Class weighting: ON (handles imbalanced cell populations via inverse-frequency weights)
   - Data augmentation: ON (Gaussian noise + per-channel scaling for measurement mode)
6. Click **Train on Current Image**
7. Review accuracy on labeled cells in the status bar

### Applying to Project

After training on the current image:

1. Click **Apply to All Project Images**
2. The trained model encodes each image's cells and assigns predicted labels
3. For tile mode, tiles are read from each image's server automatically
4. Results (labels + latent features + confidence) are saved per image

### Outputs

Each detection receives:
- `AE_0` through `AE_N` measurements: learned latent features (N = latent dimensions)
- `AE_confidence`: prediction confidence (0.0-1.0, higher = more certain)
- PathClass label: predicted cell type (only if labeled cells were provided)

The latent features (AE_*) can be used as input for clustering (select them as measurements in the clustering dialog) or visualized via UMAP.

### Performance Notes

- **Measurement mode**: Trains in seconds to minutes on CPU. GPU provides minimal benefit.
- **Tile mode (32x32)**: ~2-5 min for 1k cells on CPU, ~20-60 min for 10k cells. GPU recommended.
- **Tile mode (64x64)**: Significantly slower. GPU strongly recommended. Reduce batch size if memory errors occur.
- **Inference** (applying to project): Much faster than training -- typically seconds per image.
- **Memory**: Tile mode with 40+ channels and 64x64 tiles can require several GB of GPU memory.

### Tips

- More labeled cells = better accuracy. Aim for 100+ per class.
- If accuracy is low, try: increasing epochs, increasing latent dimensions, or adding more labeled cells.
- For tile mode, start with 32x32 tiles. Only increase if the model underperforms.
- The measurement mode is usually sufficient for marker-based phenotyping. Use tile mode when morphology or spatial texture matters.
- Run on a well-annotated image first, validate by visual inspection, then apply to the project.
- Low AE_confidence scores highlight uncertain predictions -- review these cells manually.

## 11. Exporting AnnData

Export data for use with external single-cell tools (Scanpy, Seurat, cellxgene).

1. **Extensions > QP-CAT > Export AnnData (.h5ad)...**
2. Choose a save location and filename
3. The export includes:
   - Expression matrix (all measurements)
   - Cluster labels (if cells are classified as "Cluster N")
   - Phenotype labels (if cells have other classifications)
   - Embedding coordinates (UMAP1/UMAP2, etc., if present)
   - Spatial coordinates (cell centroids)
4. Open the file in Python:

```python
import scanpy as sc
adata = sc.read_h5ad("export.h5ad")
print(adata)
```

## 12. Saving and Loading Configurations

### Clustering Configs

1. In the Clustering dialog, configure all parameters
2. Click **Save Config...**
3. Enter a name (e.g., "my-panel-leiden")
4. To restore: click **Load Config...** and select the saved configuration

Configs are stored in `<project>/qpcat/cluster_configs/`.

### Phenotype Rule Sets

1. In the Phenotyping dialog, define your markers, gates, and rules
2. Click **Save Rules...**
3. Enter a name (e.g., "Immune Panel v1")
4. To restore: click **Load Rules...** and select the saved rule set

Rule sets are stored in `<project>/qpcat/phenotype_rules/`.

---

## 13. Viewing the Python Console

Monitor Python-side output in real time.

1. **Extensions > QP-CAT > Utilities > Python Console**
2. The console shows timestamped debug messages from the Python environment
3. **Auto-scroll** toggle: keeps the view at the latest output
4. **Clear**: empties the console
5. **Save Log...**: exports the console contents to a text file

Useful for diagnosing errors, monitoring long operations, and seeing detailed Python output.

---

## 14. Reviewing the Operation Audit Trail

Every QP-CAT operation is logged to a persistent file in your project.

**Location:** `<project>/qpcat/logs/qpcat_YYYY-MM-DD.log`

Each log entry records:
- Timestamp
- Operation type (CLUSTERING, PHENOTYPING, EMBEDDING, etc.)
- All input parameters (algorithm, normalization, marker count, cell count)
- Result summary (clusters found, phenotypes assigned, etc.)
- Duration

**Example entry:**
```
=== CLUSTERING === 2026-03-09 14:23:05
  Algorithm: Leiden (graph-based)
  Algorithm params: {n_neighbors=50, resolution=1.0}
  Normalization: zscore
  Embedding: umap
  Measurements: 15 markers
  Input: 12847 cells
  Result: Clustering complete: 8 clusters found for 12847 cells.
  Duration: 4.2s
```

Log files are plain text and can be opened in any text editor. A new file is created each day automatically.
