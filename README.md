# QP-CAT: Cell Analysis Tools for QuPath

Python-powered cell analysis for highly multiplexed imaging data in [QuPath](https://qupath.github.io/).

QP-CAT embeds a full scientific Python environment (via [Appose](https://github.com/apposed/appose)) directly within QuPath -- no external servers, no conda environments to manage manually, no command-line tools. It provides unsupervised clustering, rule-based and zero-shot phenotyping, autoencoder-based cell classification, foundation model feature extraction, dimensionality reduction, spatial analysis, and interoperability export, all accessible through a GUI.

## Features

Each bullet leads with what you can *do* with QP-CAT; the algorithm name is in parentheses for when you need to know what's under the hood.

- **No-setup install** -- one click downloads and configures the full Python environment for you. No conda, no command line, no environment fights. ~1.5-2.5 GB download, ~2.5 GB on disk
- **Discover cell types without labels** -- automatic grouping of cells by their marker expression. Pick the algorithm that fits your question: Leiden or KMeans for first-pass discovery, HDBSCAN when you expect rare populations or noise, BANKSY when tissue architecture matters; plus Agglomerative, MiniBatch KMeans, and Gaussian Mixture for special cases
- **Phenotype with plain-English prompts** -- type "exhausted T cell" or "tumor-associated macrophage" and the model labels matching cells, no training required (zero-shot via [BiomedCLIP](https://huggingface.co/microsoft/BiomedCLIP-PubMedBERT_256-vit_base_patch16_224), MIT License, Microsoft)
- **Annotate a few cells, classify the rest** *(test feature)* -- label a small subset of cells in QuPath and a variational autoencoder (VAE) extends those labels to every cell in the project. Learns from your marker measurements, from the actual image patch around each cell (optionally with a CellSighter-style cell-mask channel so the network knows which cell is "the" cell), or both combined
- **Cluster on what cells look like, not just what markers say** -- pretrained vision models turn each tile into a numerical fingerprint of its morphology, so clusters can be driven by tissue appearance in addition to marker intensities. Useful when staining is variable, channels are limited, or morphology carries information your markers miss (H-optimus-0, Virchow, Hibou-B/L, Midnight, DINOv2-Large via [LazySlide](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41592-026-03044-7))
- **Cleaner clusters via tissue context** -- optional pre-step that averages each cell's features with its spatial neighbors before clustering, so niches and tissue zones come out as connected regions instead of salt-and-pepper noise. Turns any of the algorithms above into a spatially-aware version (graph convolution smoothing)
- **Marker gating with auto-thresholds** -- classic flow-cytometry-style cell typing, with sensible threshold suggestions per marker (Triangle, GMM, and Gamma auto-threshold methods)
- **Click the plot, see the cells** -- interactive UMAP / PCA / t-SNE: brush a region of the embedding and the corresponding cells highlight on the slide
- **Test where cell types live in tissue** -- ask whether two phenotypes co-localize, avoid each other, or scatter randomly across the tissue (neighborhood enrichment + Moran's I autocorrelation via squidpy)
- **Compare across slides and batches** -- batch correction so your clusters reflect biology, not slide-of-origin or staining-day effects, when you analyze a multi-image project all at once (Harmony integration)
- **Publication-ready follow-up** -- find the markers that define each cluster (Wilcoxon ranking) and generate dotplots, violin plots, and PAGA trajectory graphs without leaving QuPath
- **Easy hand-off to Python / R** -- export results as standard `.h5ad` AnnData files. Compatible with Scanpy, Seurat, and cellxgene, so you can keep going in your usual notebook when you want to
- **Reproducible audit trail** -- every operation is logged per-project with the full parameters used, so you (or a reviewer) can retrace exactly what was run, when, and how

---

## Requirements

- **QuPath** 0.6.0 or later
- **Java** 21+
- **Internet connection** for initial environment setup (~1.5-2.5 GB download)
- **Disk space** ~2.5 GB for the Python environment
- No GPU required -- all operations run on CPU (foundation model extraction benefits from GPU but works on CPU)
- **HuggingFace account** (optional) -- required only for gated models (H-optimus-0, Virchow, Hibou); set your auth token in the dialog

### Supported Algorithms

| Algorithm | Type | Auto-detects k? | Notes |
|-----------|------|:---:|-------|
| **Leiden** | Graph-based | Yes | Recommended default. Resolution parameter controls granularity. |
| **KMeans** | Centroid-based | No | Requires specifying number of clusters. |
| **HDBSCAN** | Density-based | Yes | Also identifies noise/outlier cells. |
| **Agglomerative** | Hierarchical | No | Supports ward, complete, average, and single linkage. |
| **MiniBatch KMeans** | Centroid-based | No | Scalable variant of KMeans for very large datasets. |
| **GMM** | Probabilistic | No | Gaussian mixture model with soft cluster assignment. |
| **BANKSY** | Spatially-aware | Yes | Uses both expression and spatial coordinates. See [Spatial Clustering](#banksy-spatial-clustering). |

### Normalization Methods

| Method | Description | When to use |
|--------|-------------|-------------|
| **Z-score** | Zero mean, unit variance per marker | Recommended default for most analyses |
| **Min-Max** | Scale each marker to [0, 1] | When relative intensities matter |
| **Percentile** | Robust min-max using 1st/99th percentiles | When outliers are present |
| **None** | Raw measurement values | Pre-normalized data |

### Dimensionality Reduction

UMAP, PCA, and t-SNE embeddings are computed alongside clustering and added as measurements (e.g., `UMAP1`, `UMAP2`) to each detection. These can be used for visualization in QuPath or downstream tools.

The **Compute Embedding Only** dialog allows computing embeddings without clustering, preserving existing classifications.

### Multi-Image Project Clustering

Select "All project images" scope in the clustering dialog to cluster detections across your entire project simultaneously. This ensures globally consistent cluster assignments. Optionally enable **Harmony batch correction** to remove per-image technical variation before clustering.

### Batch correction (Harmony)

QP-CAT integrates [harmonypy](https://github.com/slowkow/harmonypy) (the Python port of [Harmony](https://github.com/immunogenomics/harmony), Korsunsky et al. 2019, *Nature Methods*) to remove per-image technical variation before clustering. This is essential for multi-image / multi-batch projects where each slide carries its own staining intensity profile.

**When the checkbox is enabled in the Clustering dialog:**

- Scope is set to "All project images" (single-image mode has no batches to correct), AND
- The harmonypy package was successfully imported when the QP-CAT Python environment started.

**When the checkbox is grayed out:**

- "All project images" is not selected -> single-image clustering does not need batch correction.
- harmonypy failed to install in the Python environment -> the tooltip on the disabled checkbox links you here.

**Platform support matrix:**

| Platform | Harmony version installed | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Linux x86_64 | harmonypy 0.2.0 (pure Python) | Supported |
| macOS (Intel + Apple Silicon) | harmonypy 0.2.0 (pure Python) | Supported |
| Windows x86_64 | harmonypy 0.2.0 (pure Python) | Supported |

QP-CAT pins `harmonypy >= 0.2.0, < 2`. Version 2.0.0+ is a pybind11/CMake build with no Windows wheel, which would force users to install MSVC Build Tools to use this feature. The 0.2.x series is the latest pure-Python release with the same `run_harmony()` API.

**If the checkbox is unexpectedly grayed out:**

1. Open the QP-CAT Python log (Extensions > QP-CAT > System Info, or check the QuPath log).
2. Look for the line `harmonypy: <version>` -- if you instead see `harmonypy: NOT INSTALLED`, the env build skipped or failed for this package.
3. **Use Extensions > QP-CAT > Utilities > Rebuild Clustering Environment** to delete and re-create the pixi env from a clean slate. This re-resolves the harmonypy pin and should produce a working install.
4. If rebuild still fails, file a bug report with the full QuPath log attached.

<summary><h2>Phenotyping</h2></summary>

Rule-based cell type classification using marker gating thresholds.

### Workflow

1. **Extensions > QP-CAT > Run Phenotyping...**
2. Select markers to use as gating channels
3. Set per-marker gate thresholds (manually or via auto-thresholding)
4. Define phenotype rules: each rule maps a cell type name to marker conditions (positive/negative)
5. Rules are evaluated in order (first match wins); unmatched cells are labeled "Unknown"

### Auto-Thresholding

Click **Compute Thresholds** to calculate suggested gate values for each marker using three methods:

| Method | Algorithm | Best for |
|--------|-----------|----------|
| **Triangle** | Geometric method from histogram shape | Skewed distributions with dominant negative peak |
| **GMM** | 2-component Gaussian mixture model | Bimodal distributions |
| **Gamma** | Gamma distribution fit (GammaGateR-inspired) | Right-skewed, strictly positive marker data |

Select a marker column header to view its histogram with an interactive draggable threshold line.

### Saving and Loading Rule Sets

Phenotype rules, gates, and marker selections can be saved to and loaded from the QuPath project directory (`<project>/qpcat/phenotype_rules/`). This allows reuse across sessions and sharing between team members.

</details>

<details>
<summary><h2>Spatial Analysis</h2></summary>

When enabled in the clustering dialog, QP-CAT computes spatial statistics using cell centroid coordinates:

- **Neighborhood enrichment** -- Z-score matrix showing which clusters tend to co-localize (or avoid each other) in tissue space
- **Moran's I autocorrelation** -- Per-marker spatial autocorrelation, identifying markers with spatially structured expression patterns

Results are displayed in the results dialog and available as static plot outputs.

### BANKSY Spatial Clustering

[BANKSY](https://github.com/prabhakarlab/Banksy_py) integrates spatial neighborhood information directly into the clustering algorithm. It augments each cell's expression profile with a weighted average of its spatial neighbors' expression, then clusters on the combined representation.

Parameters:
- **lambda** (0-1): Weight of spatial vs. expression information (0.2 is a good starting point)
- **k_geom**: Number of spatial nearest neighbors
- **resolution**: Leiden resolution for the final clustering step

### Spatial Feature Smoothing

Spatial feature smoothing is a graph convolution pre-step that can be enabled for **any** clustering algorithm. When enabled, each cell's features are smoothed with its spatial neighbors before clustering, encouraging nearby cells to receive similar cluster assignments.

How it works:
1. A k-nearest neighbor graph is built from cell centroid coordinates
2. The adjacency matrix is row-normalized so each cell's neighbors contribute equally
3. Each cell's feature vector is replaced by a weighted average of itself and its neighbors
4. The smoothed features are then passed to the selected clustering algorithm

Enable the **"Spatial feature smoothing"** checkbox in the clustering dialog. The parameter **k** controls the number of spatial nearest neighbors (default 15).

This is a lighter-weight alternative to BANKSY when you want spatial awareness without switching to a fully spatial algorithm.

<summary><h2>Foundation Model Feature Extraction</h2></summary>

**Extensions > QP-CAT > Extract Foundation Model Features...** extracts tile-level morphological embeddings from pre-trained vision foundation models and stores them as per-detection measurements (`FM_0`, `FM_1`, ..., `FM_N`).

### Supported Models

| Model | Developer | License | Embedding Dim | Gated? |
|-------|-----------|---------|:---:|:---:|
| **H-optimus-0** | Bioptimus | Apache 2.0 | 1536 | Yes |
| **Virchow** | Paige AI | Apache 2.0 | 2560 | Yes |
| **Hibou-B** | HistAI | Apache 2.0 | 768 | Yes |
| **Hibou-L** | HistAI | Apache 2.0 | 1024 | Yes |
| **Midnight** | kaiko.ai | Apache 2.0 | 768 | No |
| **DINOv2-Large** | Meta AI | Apache 2.0 | 1024 | No |

All models are downloaded on-demand from HuggingFace and cached locally -- they are not bundled with the extension. Only models with commercially permissive licenses (Apache 2.0) are included.

**Gated models** (H-optimus-0, Virchow, Hibou) require a HuggingFace account and auth token. Accept the model's license on its HuggingFace page, then enter your token in the extraction dialog.

Foundation model features capture rich morphological information from the image tile surrounding each cell. They can be used as input measurements for clustering (instead of or alongside channel intensity measurements), enabling morphology-driven cell grouping.

Feature extraction is powered by [LazySlide](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41592-026-03044-7).

<summary><h2>Zero-Shot Phenotyping</h2></summary>

**Extensions > QP-CAT > Zero-Shot Phenotyping (BiomedCLIP)...** assigns cell phenotypes using natural language text prompts -- no marker gating rules or training data required.

### How It Works

1. Image tiles are extracted around each cell detection
2. [BiomedCLIP](https://huggingface.co/microsoft/BiomedCLIP-PubMedBERT_256-vit_base_patch16_224) (MIT License, Microsoft) computes vision-language similarity between each tile and your text prompts
3. Each cell is assigned the phenotype whose text prompt best matches its image tile
4. A confidence score is stored alongside each assignment

### Usage

1. Open the dialog and enter phenotype text prompts, one per line (e.g., "lymphocyte", "tumor cell", "stromal cell", "macrophage")
2. Click **Run**
3. Each detection receives a classification matching the highest-scoring prompt

BiomedCLIP is downloaded on-demand from HuggingFace and cached locally. It does not require a HuggingFace auth token.

<summary><h2>[TEST] Autoencoder Cell Classifier</h2></summary>

**Extensions > QP-CAT > [TEST] Autoencoder Classifier...** trains a variational autoencoder (VAE) with a semi-supervised classifier head on cell measurements. This is a **test feature** under active development.

### How It Works

1. Label cells using one or more methods:
   - **Locked annotations** (default ON): draw region, assign class, lock it -- all detections inside inherit the class
   - **Point annotations** (default ON): use Points tool with a class to click on individual cells
   - **Detection classifications** (default OFF): use existing PathClass labels on detections
2. Select one or more project images for training (multi-image for better generalization)
3. The VAE learns a compressed latent representation from all cells
4. A classifier head trained on the labeled subset propagates labels to all cells
5. The trained model can be applied across all images in a project

### Architecture

- **Encoder**: Measurements -> 128 -> 64 -> latent space (configurable dim, default 16)
- **Decoder**: Latent space -> 64 -> 128 -> reconstructed measurements (Gaussian likelihood)
- **Classifier**: Latent space -> class probabilities (semi-supervised)

Follows the scANVI pattern (Xu et al. 2021) adapted for continuous protein measurements.

### Training Modes

- **Semi-supervised** (recommended): Some cells labeled, rest unlabeled. Reconstruction shapes the latent space; labels guide it.
- **Fully supervised**: All cells labeled. Classification drives latent structure.
- **Unsupervised**: No labels. VAE learns reconstruction only (set supervision weight to 0).

### Output

- `AE_0` through `AE_N` measurements: latent features per cell
- `AE_confidence`: classifier confidence score
- PathClass labels: predicted cell type
- Trained model can be applied to other images via "Apply to All Project Images"

### Input Modes

- **Measurements** (default): Uses per-cell measurement values (e.g., mean channel intensities). MLP encoder/decoder. Fast (seconds to minutes on CPU). No GPU required.
- **Tile images**: Uses multi-channel pixel tiles centered on each cell. Convolutional encoder/decoder. Captures spatial morphology and texture that measurements miss. All image channels included automatically. Optionally appends a binary cell mask channel (CellSighter approach, Amitay et al. 2023, Nature Communications). Benefits from GPU; CPU is slower.
- **Hybrid (Tile + Measurements)**: In tile mode, selected measurements can be included as a secondary input alongside pixel tiles. The model uses a Hybrid ConvVAE architecture where convolutional features from the image tile are concatenated with measurement values before the latent space. This combines spatial/morphological information from pixels with quantitative features like Solidity, Area, Circularity, or channel intensities. Select measurements in the measurement panel even when tile mode is active to enable hybrid input.

### Cell Mask Channel (Tile Mode)

When "Include cell mask channel" is checked (default ON), a binary mask of the target cell's ROI is appended as an extra channel. The mask acts as an attention guide:

- 1.0 inside the cell boundary, 0.0 outside
- Neighboring cell pixels are NOT zeroed out -- their context is informative
- The network learns which cell to classify while using spatial context from neighbors
- Based on CellSighter (Amitay et al. 2023) which showed neighbor spillover patterns help classification in multiplexed imaging

For additional discriminative power, morphology measurements such as Solidity, Area, and Circularity can be combined with tile input via the hybrid mode (see [Input Modes](#input-modes)).

### Performance Considerations

| Mode | Dataset Size | Approx. Training Time (CPU) | GPU Benefit |
|------|-------------|----------------------------|-------------|
| Measurements | 1,000 cells | ~30 seconds | Minimal |
| Measurements | 10,000 cells | ~3 minutes | Minimal |
| Measurements | 50,000 cells | ~15 minutes | Moderate |
| Tile images 32x32 | 1,000 cells | ~2-5 minutes | Significant |
| Tile images 32x32 | 10,000 cells | ~20-60 minutes | Significant |
| Tile images 64x64 | 10,000 cells | ~1-3 hours | Required |

Tile mode is substantially slower than measurement mode because the convolutional network processes spatial pixel data. For large datasets or tile sizes above 32x32, GPU is strongly recommended.

Inference (applying a trained model) is much faster than training -- typically seconds per image regardless of mode.

### Training Features

VAE best practices and training infrastructure:

| Feature | Description | Default |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| **Gaussian NLL** | Learned per-feature variance for heteroscedastic noise (measurement mode) | ON |
| **Cyclical KL annealing** | 4-cycle ramp prevents posterior collapse (Fu et al. 2019) | beta_max=0.5 |
| **Free bits** | Min KL per latent dim prevents dimension collapse (Kingma et al. 2016) | 0.25 nats |
| **LayerNorm** | Per-sample normalization (preferred over BatchNorm for VAEs) | ON |
| **Logvar clamping** | Numerical stability for variance outputs | [-10, 10] |
| **Unsupervised pre-training** | Train reconstruction before classification | 10% of epochs |
| **Label-fraction scaling** | Classification weight scaled by N_total/N_labeled | Auto |
| **Active units monitoring** | Warns on posterior collapse (low active latent dims) | Auto |
| **R-squared diagnostics** | Per-feature reconstruction quality check | Auto |
| **Class weighting** | Inverse-frequency weights for imbalanced populations | ON |
| **Per-class weight spinners** | Manual per-class weight adjustment via individual spinners in the dialog | 1.0 each |
| **Auto-Balance** | Button that computes inverse-frequency weights and populates per-class spinners automatically | -- |
| **Validation split** | Stratified holdout set for monitoring overfitting | 20% |
| **Early stopping** | Stop when val accuracy plateaus; restore best model | Patience=15 |
| **ReduceLROnPlateau** | Halve LR when loss plateaus (standard VAE scheduler) | factor=0.5 |
| **Mixed precision** | FP16 on CUDA for ~2x speedup | Auto (CUDA only) |
| **Gradient clipping** | Prevents exploding gradients | max_norm=1.0 |
| **Adam optimizer** | No weight decay (conflicts with KL regularization) | lr=0.001 |
| **Data augmentation** | Noise + scaling + feature dropout (measurement mode) | ON |

### Current Limitations (Test Feature)

- No data augmentation for tile mode yet (spatial transforms planned)
- Fixed encoder architecture (3-layer conv or 2-layer MLP); no architecture tuning
- Training loss displayed in log only, no live chart
- Tile mode with many channels (40+) and large tiles (64x64) can exhaust GPU memory
- Results should be validated before use in published analyses

<summary><h2>Troubleshooting</h2></summary>

### Environment setup fails

- Check your internet connection -- the initial download is ~1.5-2.5 GB
- Check available disk space (~2.5 GB required)
- Try **Rebuild Environment** to start fresh
- Check the Python Console for detailed error messages

### "No detections found"

QP-CAT operates on detection objects (cells). Run cell detection first:
- **Analyze > Cell detection** in QuPath, or
- Use StarDist, Cellpose, or another detection method

### Clustering produces unexpected results

- Try different normalization methods -- Z-score is recommended for most data
- Adjust algorithm parameters (e.g., Leiden resolution, HDBSCAN min_cluster_size)
- Check the marker selection -- "Mean" measurements are usually best for clustering
- View the interactive heatmap to assess cluster quality

### Memory issues with large datasets

- Use MiniBatch KMeans for datasets with >100,000 cells
- Reduce the number of selected measurements
