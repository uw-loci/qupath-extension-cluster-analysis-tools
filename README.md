# QP-CAT: Cell Analysis Tools for QuPath

Python-powered cell analysis for highly multiplexed imaging data in [QuPath](https://qupath.github.io/).

QP-CAT embeds a full scientific Python environment (via [Appose](https://github.com/apposed/appose)) directly within QuPath -- no external servers, no conda environments to manage manually, no command-line tools. It provides unsupervised clustering, rule-based and zero-shot phenotyping, autoencoder-based cell classification, foundation model feature extraction, dimensionality reduction, spatial analysis, and interoperability export, all accessible through a GUI.

---

## Installation

### From GitHub Releases

1. Download the latest `.jar` from the [Releases](https://github.com/uw-loci/qupath-extension-cell-analysis-tools/releases) page
2. Drag the JAR onto the QuPath window, or place it in your QuPath extensions directory
3. Restart QuPath
4. Go to **Extensions > QP-CAT > Setup Clustering Environment** and click "Setup"
5. Wait for the Python environment to build (first time only, ~5-10 minutes)

### Building from Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/uw-loci/qupath-extension-cell-analysis-tools.git
cd qupath-extension-cell-analysis-tools
./gradlew build
```

The built JAR will be in `build/libs/`. Copy it to your QuPath extensions directory.

---

## Quick Start

1. Open an image in QuPath with cell detections (run cell detection first if needed)
2. **Extensions > QP-CAT > Run Clustering...**
3. Select measurements (defaults to "Mean" intensity channels)
4. Choose algorithm (Leiden recommended) and click **Run Clustering**
5. Results are applied directly to detections as classifications (Cluster 0, Cluster 1, ...)
6. View interactive heatmaps, scatter plots, and marker rankings in the results dialog

For even faster exploration, use **Quick Cluster** submenu items which run with sensible defaults.

---

## Clustering

### Supported Algorithms

| Algorithm | Type | Auto-detects k? | Notes |
|-----------|------|:---:|-------|
| **Leiden** | Graph-based | Yes | Recommended default. Resolution parameter controls granularity. |
| **KMeans** | Centroid-based | No | Requires specifying number of clusters. |
| **HDBSCAN** | Density-based | Yes | Also identifies noise/outlier cells. |
| **Agglomerative** | Hierarchical | No | Supports ward, complete, average, and single linkage. |
| **MiniBatch KMeans** | Centroid-based | No | Scalable variant of KMeans for very large datasets. |
| **GMM** | Probabilistic | No | Gaussian mixture model with soft cluster assignment. |
| **BANKSY** | Spatially-aware | Yes | Uses both expression and spatial coordinates. See [Spatial Clustering](#banksy-spatial-clustering). |

### Normalization Methods

| Method | Description | When to use |
|--------|-------------|-------------|
| **Z-score** | Zero mean, unit variance per marker | Recommended default for most analyses |
| **Min-Max** | Scale each marker to [0, 1] | When relative intensities matter |
| **Percentile** | Robust min-max using 1st/99th percentiles | When outliers are present |
| **None** | Raw measurement values | Pre-normalized data |

### Dimensionality Reduction

UMAP, PCA, and t-SNE embeddings are computed alongside clustering and added as measurements (e.g., `UMAP1`, `UMAP2`) to each detection. These can be used for visualization in QuPath or downstream tools.

The **Compute Embedding Only** dialog allows computing embeddings without clustering, preserving existing classifications.

### Multi-Image Project Clustering

Select "All project images" scope in the clustering dialog to cluster detections across your entire project simultaneously. This ensures globally consistent cluster assignments. Optionally enable **Harmony batch correction** to remove per-image technical variation before clustering.

---

## Phenotyping

Rule-based cell type classification using marker gating thresholds.

### Workflow

1. **Extensions > QP-CAT > Run Phenotyping...**
2. Select markers to use as gating channels
3. Set per-marker gate thresholds (manually or via auto-thresholding)
4. Define phenotype rules: each rule maps a cell type name to marker conditions (positive/negative)
5. Rules are evaluated in order (first match wins); unmatched cells are labeled "Unknown"

### Auto-Thresholding

Click **Compute Thresholds** to calculate suggested gate values for each marker using three methods:

| Method | Algorithm | Best for |
|--------|-----------|----------|
| **Triangle** | Geometric method from histogram shape | Skewed distributions with dominant negative peak |
| **GMM** | 2-component Gaussian mixture model | Bimodal distributions |
| **Gamma** | Gamma distribution fit (GammaGateR-inspired) | Right-skewed, strictly positive marker data |

Select a marker column header to view its histogram with an interactive draggable threshold line.

### Saving and Loading Rule Sets

Phenotype rules, gates, and marker selections can be saved to and loaded from the QuPath project directory (`<project>/qpcat/phenotype_rules/`). This allows reuse across sessions and sharing between team members.

---

## Spatial Analysis

When enabled in the clustering dialog, QP-CAT computes spatial statistics using cell centroid coordinates:

- **Neighborhood enrichment** -- Z-score matrix showing which clusters tend to co-localize (or avoid each other) in tissue space
- **Moran's I autocorrelation** -- Per-marker spatial autocorrelation, identifying markers with spatially structured expression patterns

Results are displayed in the results dialog and available as static plot outputs.

### BANKSY Spatial Clustering

[BANKSY](https://github.com/prabhakarlab/Banksy_py) integrates spatial neighborhood information directly into the clustering algorithm. It augments each cell's expression profile with a weighted average of its spatial neighbors' expression, then clusters on the combined representation.

Parameters:
- **lambda** (0-1): Weight of spatial vs. expression information (0.2 is a good starting point)
- **k_geom**: Number of spatial nearest neighbors
- **resolution**: Leiden resolution for the final clustering step

### Spatial Feature Smoothing

Spatial feature smoothing is a graph convolution pre-step that can be enabled for **any** clustering algorithm. When enabled, each cell's features are smoothed with its spatial neighbors before clustering, encouraging nearby cells to receive similar cluster assignments.

How it works:
1. A k-nearest neighbor graph is built from cell centroid coordinates
2. The adjacency matrix is row-normalized so each cell's neighbors contribute equally
3. Each cell's feature vector is replaced by a weighted average of itself and its neighbors
4. The smoothed features are then passed to the selected clustering algorithm

Enable the **"Spatial feature smoothing"** checkbox in the clustering dialog. The parameter **k** controls the number of spatial nearest neighbors (default 15).

This is a lighter-weight alternative to BANKSY when you want spatial awareness without switching to a fully spatial algorithm.

---

## Foundation Model Feature Extraction

**Extensions > QP-CAT > Extract Foundation Model Features...** extracts tile-level morphological embeddings from pre-trained vision foundation models and stores them as per-detection measurements (`FM_0`, `FM_1`, ..., `FM_N`).

### Supported Models

| Model | Developer | License | Embedding Dim | Gated? |
|-------|-----------|---------|:---:|:---:|
| **H-optimus-0** | Bioptimus | Apache 2.0 | 1536 | Yes |
| **Virchow** | Paige AI | Apache 2.0 | 2560 | Yes |
| **Hibou-B** | HistAI | Apache 2.0 | 768 | Yes |
| **Hibou-L** | HistAI | Apache 2.0 | 1024 | Yes |
| **Midnight** | kaiko.ai | Apache 2.0 | 768 | No |
| **DINOv2-Large** | Meta AI | Apache 2.0 | 1024 | No |

All models are downloaded on-demand from HuggingFace and cached locally -- they are not bundled with the extension. Only models with commercially permissive licenses (Apache 2.0) are included.

**Gated models** (H-optimus-0, Virchow, Hibou) require a HuggingFace account and auth token. Accept the model's license on its HuggingFace page, then enter your token in the extraction dialog.

Foundation model features capture rich morphological information from the image tile surrounding each cell. They can be used as input measurements for clustering (instead of or alongside channel intensity measurements), enabling morphology-driven cell grouping.

Feature extraction is powered by [LazySlide](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41592-026-03044-7).

---

## Zero-Shot Phenotyping

**Extensions > QP-CAT > Zero-Shot Phenotyping (BiomedCLIP)...** assigns cell phenotypes using natural language text prompts -- no marker gating rules or training data required.

### How It Works

1. Image tiles are extracted around each cell detection
2. [BiomedCLIP](https://huggingface.co/microsoft/BiomedCLIP-PubMedBERT_256-vit_base_patch16_224) (MIT License, Microsoft) computes vision-language similarity between each tile and your text prompts
3. Each cell is assigned the phenotype whose text prompt best matches its image tile
4. A confidence score is stored alongside each assignment

### Usage

1. Open the dialog and enter phenotype text prompts, one per line (e.g., "lymphocyte", "tumor cell", "stromal cell", "macrophage")
2. Click **Run**
3. Each detection receives a classification matching the highest-scoring prompt

BiomedCLIP is downloaded on-demand from HuggingFace and cached locally. It does not require a HuggingFace auth token.

## [TEST] Autoencoder Cell Classifier

**Extensions > QP-CAT > [TEST] Autoencoder Classifier...** trains a variational autoencoder (VAE) with a semi-supervised classifier head on cell measurements. This is a **test feature** under active development.

### How It Works

1. Label cells using one or more methods:
   - **Locked annotations** (default ON): draw region, assign class, lock it -- all detections inside inherit the class
   - **Point annotations** (default ON): use Points tool with a class to click on individual cells
   - **Detection classifications** (default OFF): use existing PathClass labels on detections
2. Select one or more project images for training (multi-image for better generalization)
3. The VAE learns a compressed latent representation from all cells
4. A classifier head trained on the labeled subset propagates labels to all cells
5. The trained model can be applied across all images in a project

### Architecture

- **Encoder**: Measurements -> 128 -> 64 -> latent space (configurable dim, default 16)
- **Decoder**: Latent space -> 64 -> 128 -> reconstructed measurements (Gaussian likelihood)
- **Classifier**: Latent space -> class probabilities (semi-supervised)

Follows the scANVI pattern (Xu et al. 2021) adapted for continuous protein measurements.

### Training Modes

- **Semi-supervised** (recommended): Some cells labeled, rest unlabeled. Reconstruction shapes the latent space; labels guide it.
- **Fully supervised**: All cells labeled. Classification drives latent structure.
- **Unsupervised**: No labels. VAE learns reconstruction only (set supervision weight to 0).

### Output

- `AE_0` through `AE_N` measurements: latent features per cell
- `AE_confidence`: classifier confidence score
- PathClass labels: predicted cell type
- Trained model can be applied to other images via "Apply to All Project Images"

### Input Modes

- **Measurements** (default): Uses per-cell measurement values (e.g., mean channel intensities). MLP encoder/decoder. Fast (seconds to minutes on CPU). No GPU required.
- **Tile images**: Uses multi-channel pixel tiles centered on each cell. Convolutional encoder/decoder. Captures spatial morphology and texture that measurements miss. All image channels included automatically. Optionally appends a binary cell mask channel (CellSighter approach, Amitay et al. 2023, Nature Communications). Benefits from GPU; CPU is slower.

### Cell Mask Channel (Tile Mode)

When "Include cell mask channel" is checked (default ON), a binary mask of the target cell's ROI is appended as an extra channel. The mask acts as an attention guide:

- 1.0 inside the cell boundary, 0.0 outside
- Neighboring cell pixels are NOT zeroed out -- their context is informative
- The network learns which cell to classify while using spatial context from neighbors
- Based on CellSighter (Amitay et al. 2023) which showed neighbor spillover patterns help classification in multiplexed imaging

### Performance Considerations

| Mode | Dataset Size | Approx. Training Time (CPU) | GPU Benefit |
|------|-------------|----------------------------|-------------|
| Measurements | 1,000 cells | ~30 seconds | Minimal |
| Measurements | 10,000 cells | ~3 minutes | Minimal |
| Measurements | 50,000 cells | ~15 minutes | Moderate |
| Tile images 32x32 | 1,000 cells | ~2-5 minutes | Significant |
| Tile images 32x32 | 10,000 cells | ~20-60 minutes | Significant |
| Tile images 64x64 | 10,000 cells | ~1-3 hours | Required |

Tile mode is substantially slower than measurement mode because the convolutional network processes spatial pixel data. For large datasets or tile sizes above 32x32, GPU is strongly recommended.

Inference (applying a trained model) is much faster than training -- typically seconds per image regardless of mode.

### Training Features

VAE best practices and training infrastructure:

| Feature | Description | Default |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| **Gaussian NLL** | Learned per-feature variance for heteroscedastic noise (measurement mode) | ON |
| **Cyclical KL annealing** | 4-cycle ramp prevents posterior collapse (Fu et al. 2019) | beta_max=0.5 |
| **Free bits** | Min KL per latent dim prevents dimension collapse (Kingma et al. 2016) | 0.25 nats |
| **LayerNorm** | Per-sample normalization (preferred over BatchNorm for VAEs) | ON |
| **Logvar clamping** | Numerical stability for variance outputs | [-10, 10] |
| **Unsupervised pre-training** | Train reconstruction before classification | 10% of epochs |
| **Label-fraction scaling** | Classification weight scaled by N_total/N_labeled | Auto |
| **Active units monitoring** | Warns on posterior collapse (low active latent dims) | Auto |
| **R-squared diagnostics** | Per-feature reconstruction quality check | Auto |
| **Class weighting** | Inverse-frequency weights for imbalanced populations | ON |
| **Validation split** | Stratified holdout set for monitoring overfitting | 20% |
| **Early stopping** | Stop when val accuracy plateaus; restore best model | Patience=15 |
| **ReduceLROnPlateau** | Halve LR when loss plateaus (standard VAE scheduler) | factor=0.5 |
| **Mixed precision** | FP16 on CUDA for ~2x speedup | Auto (CUDA only) |
| **Gradient clipping** | Prevents exploding gradients | max_norm=1.0 |
| **Adam optimizer** | No weight decay (conflicts with KL regularization) | lr=0.001 |
| **Data augmentation** | Noise + scaling + feature dropout (measurement mode) | ON |

### Current Limitations (Test Feature)

- No data augmentation for tile mode yet (spatial transforms planned)
- Fixed encoder architecture (3-layer conv or 2-layer MLP); no architecture tuning
- Training loss displayed in log only, no live chart
- Tile mode with many channels (40+) and large tiles (64x64) can exhaust GPU memory
- Results should be validated before use in published analyses

## Post-Analysis Outputs

After clustering, QP-CAT can generate:

| Output | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Interactive heatmap** | Cluster-by-marker mean expression with click-to-select |
| **Interactive scatter** | UMAP/PCA/t-SNE plot colored by cluster, zoomable and pannable |
| **Marker rankings** | Top differentially expressed markers per cluster (Wilcoxon rank-sum test) |
| **PAGA graph** | Cluster connectivity/trajectory graph |
| **Dotplot** | Fraction expressing + mean expression per cluster per marker |
| **Stacked violin** | Expression distributions per cluster |
| **Spatial scatter** | Cell positions colored by cluster (when spatial analysis enabled) |

---

## Data Export

### AnnData (.h5ad)

Export your data to the AnnData format for use with external tools:

- **Extensions > QP-CAT > Export AnnData (.h5ad)...**

The exported file includes:
- All selected measurements as the expression matrix
- Cluster assignments (if present)
- Phenotype labels (if present)
- Embedding coordinates (UMAP/PCA/t-SNE if computed)
- Spatial coordinates (cell centroids)

Compatible with Scanpy, Seurat (via SeuratDisk), cellxgene, and other single-cell analysis tools.

---

## Cluster Management

**Extensions > QP-CAT > Manage Clusters...** opens a dialog for post-hoc cluster organization:

- **Rename** -- Change a cluster's classification name (e.g., "Cluster 3" -> "CD8+ T Cells")
- **Merge** -- Combine two or more clusters into one with a user-specified name

Changes are applied directly to detection objects and reflected immediately in QuPath's viewer.

---

## Configuration Persistence

### Clustering Configs

Save and load clustering parameter sets (algorithm, parameters, measurement selection, normalization, embedding settings) within a QuPath project. Stored in `<project>/qpcat/cluster_configs/`.

### Operation Audit Trail

Every operation (clustering, phenotyping, embedding, export, threshold computation) is logged with full parameters, timestamps, cell counts, and results to per-day log files at:

```
<project>/qpcat/logs/qpcat_YYYY-MM-DD.log
```

This provides a reproducibility trail -- you can always see exactly what parameters were used for any analysis. Log files are human-readable text.

---

## Python Console

**Extensions > QP-CAT > Utilities > Python Console** opens a window showing real-time Python stderr/debug output from the embedded Python environment. Useful for:

- Monitoring long-running operations
- Debugging Python-side errors
- Viewing detailed progress messages

The console includes a **Save Log...** button to export its contents to a text file.

---

## Python Environment

QP-CAT manages its own isolated Python environment via [Appose](https://github.com/apposed/appose) and [pixi](https://pixi.sh/). The environment is stored at:

```
~/.local/share/appose/qupath-qpcat/    (Linux/macOS)
%LOCALAPPDATA%\appose\qupath-qpcat\    (Windows)
```

## Troubleshooting

### Environment setup fails

- Check your internet connection -- the initial download is ~1.5-2.5 GB
- Check available disk space (~2.5 GB required)
- Try **Rebuild Environment** to start fresh
- Check the Python Console for detailed error messages

### "No detections found"

QP-CAT operates on detection objects (cells). Run cell detection first:
- **Analyze > Cell detection** in QuPath, or
- Use StarDist, Cellpose, or another detection method

### Clustering produces unexpected results

- Try different normalization methods -- Z-score is recommended for most data
- Adjust algorithm parameters (e.g., Leiden resolution, HDBSCAN min_cluster_size)
- Check the marker selection -- "Mean" measurements are usually best for clustering
- View the interactive heatmap to assess cluster quality

### Memory issues with large datasets

- Use MiniBatch KMeans for datasets with >100,000 cells
- Reduce the number of selected measurements
- Consider clustering a subset (select detections within an annotation)
